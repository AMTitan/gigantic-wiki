## Strategy

---

Imani is easily one of the most powerful heroes in Gigantic, but she requires a player who knows how to best utilize her to unlock her true power. While on paper she is untouchable in terms of damage, she dies extremely quickly even with good support. Accordingly, as long as you keep Imani moving, snipe from different locations, and do your best to control the crowd, she's super powerful. Her **[RMB/LT] SILENT SCOPE** skill increases damage the more time you stayed zoomed in, which leads to some pretty dramatic damage if used properly and with someone who has good aim.

## Tips and Tricks

---

- Once you reached at least 75% [health](/Mechanics/health), escape as Imani has little movement.
- Preserve your [stamina](/Mechanics/stamina) as best you can, because you're going to need it as the fast moving unit of your team.
- Use **[LMB/RT] AUTOBOLTS** instead of **[RMB/LT] SILENT SCOPE**, as your scope limits your vision and movement. Only using your scope when you need the distance is a great way to make yourself more useful.
- Your attacks are all based on line of sight, so get right into the fray as soon as you can.
- Imani can be taken out really easily by assassins and other shooters, so use Frost Bolt (upgrade of **[Q/LB] SPECIAL AMMO**) and **[E/RB] SMOKE BOMB** whenever you see the threat coming.
- **[F/LS+RT],[LMB/RT] KILL SHOT** [Focus](/Mechanics/focus) ability, allows you to shoot 3 massive shots so make all three hit and do not wait as well as her focus has a timer.
- **[Q/LB] SPECIAL AMMO**
  - Special bolts could deal small area damage which could take out multiple enemies at the same time.
  - [Burning](/Mechanics/burn) is super useful, and can really keep pressure on enemies over time. You can also use it to augment damage against tanks, because as they see their health moving, they're going to move further out from the center.
- **[E/RB] SMOKE BOMB**
  - Smoke bomb actually [weaken](/Mechanics/weaken) enemies if made contact so use that in the heat of combat to give your team an advantage.
  - [Jump](/Mechanics/jump) before using the upgraded Smoke Bomb for better survivability.

## Notes

---

- Autobolts: “The Records division credits her with 104 kills in the Dreytalian Incursion... and that war lasted only 19 days.” – General Adron, House Aurion
- Silent Scope: In winter, Imani puts snow in her mouth so her frosty breath doesn't give away her position.
- Special Ammo: “My craft is endless improvisation, for no two targets are alike.” – Imani
- Smoke Bomb: “She was so well hidden that the Drey soldiers gave up on return fire. Instead, they launched artillery salvos.” – Gruth's Tales of War, Vol. 3
- Kill Shot: “I swear Imani can see through both eyes. She just wears the eyepatch to preserve her sharp vision for 'special targets.'” – Roland
- Reborn : “I won't forget that night, the way her voice wavered as she pled, ‘Who am I?’ I wish I had the answers she sought.” – Captain Imani
- The Adventurer II :
  - The Captain called her reckless and unprofessional. Beckett simply laughed and flew away.
- The Pyromancer V:
  - The captain's calm leadership taught Charnok to focus in battle. He would always respect Imani for that.
- The Ruffian V:
  - “He's effective. Too effective.” – Captain Imani
